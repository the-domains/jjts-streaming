            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Benefits of Webinar</h1><p>A webinar is a neologism, short for a Web-based Seminar, a presentation, lecture, workshop or seminar that is transmitted over the Web. It is typically one-way form of communication from the speaker to the audience with limited audience interaction primarily through chat. Most webinars are of the audio + PowerPoint + interactive type. A webinar can be collaborative and include polling and question and answer sessions to allow full participation between the audience and the presenter.</p></article>]]></description>

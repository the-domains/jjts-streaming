# How to promote your Live stream

## The Basics

Planning is needed for a successful live stream. This includes giving yourself time to prepare and amble room for error. As a starting point, make sure you have at least 48 hours from when you schedule the event from its launch. The more time the better.

In addition, recognize your viewers have choices. Video content is everywhere. Choices at times feel limitless. You will have to create a pitch on why viewers should watch your stream, and keep them interested up until the venue starts. Don't assume because someone is informed they will remember on the day of the event to tune in. Repetition and timing of promotion is key.

Also, ask yourself if you need a program for your broadcast. Are you streaming all day? If the answer is yes, you need a program. Don't expect that viewers will watch an entire stream to get see the part they want. If you are broadcasting a series of sports games, for example, post a program of when each team might play. This will keep the content as relevant as possible for viewers. It will also avoid unneeded frustrations that might cause your audience to avoid watching altogether.

Importantly, don't hijack your own live stream. This is most relevant to event holders that offer a live stream in parallel with an in person option. Don't be afraid to promote your live stream just because you prefer people to buy a ticket to a concert or trade show. People will still prefer the in person approach. The live stream will not steal its thunder, and a failure to promote under this fear will doom your live broadcast.

## Set a Goal

Finally, set a goal for the projected outcome. Is this the first live stream in a series? If so make sure to mention when the next event might be. If you don't have the next one scheduled, at least inform viewers where they might find this information in the future. Getting an audience to come back again is always much easier, and cost effective, then getting a whole new audience.

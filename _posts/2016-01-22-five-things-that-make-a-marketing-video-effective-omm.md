description: "This video is very effective. It's fun, it's memorable, it's evocative and it's something that you want to share. It informs you, it engages you, it moves you and it's very well done. Wow. Sponsored by RIOTUR, the City of Rio de Janeiro's tourism authority, this video was created to support RIO's bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics."

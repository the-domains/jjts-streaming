# Location Shooting

The vast majority of JJTS work is out and about. Sometimes we're integrated into an event but the rest of the time we're filming on location and producing a video.

The level of detail that goes into planning an outside broadcast or shoot is often overlooked. The little details noticeable in JJTS and their approach is a breath of fresh air, Dave Tozer's sound mixer and radio mic kit is exactly the right size for hand luggage on international flights meaning He's never been caught short waiting for kit that hasn't turned up at the other end.

From the very first quote we give you know that nothing will be missed out meaning you get a bill bigger than you're expecting. Mileage, parking, hotel costs are all looked at as soon as you get in touch which means you'll get the best rate and get great value on your final video.

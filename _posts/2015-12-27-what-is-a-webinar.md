A webinar is a neologism, short for a Web-based Seminar, a presentation, lecture, workshop or seminar that is transmitted over the Web. It is typically one-way form of communication from the speaker to the audience with limited audience interaction primarily through chat. Most webinars are of the audio + PowerPoint + interactive type. A webinar can be collaborative and include polling and question and answer sessions to allow full participation between the audience and the presenter.

Webinars are excellent tools of marketing for engaging the audiences and advertising subtly without a direct impact on the brand, product or services that they transmit.

Webinars can be conducted through speakers present locally as well as globally. As the attention span of the online viewers does not go beyond 2-3 hours, the agenda of the webinar requires careful planning so as to ensure complete and enthusiastic participation. The two significant pillars of success for Webinar are the speaker and the topic. A creation of the webinar portal for the user is also possible wherein the archived as well as the upcoming webinars can be put on display for the benefit of the audience.

A series of webinars conducted once in a month ensures your presence with the customers all the year round. Knowledge and information is just a mouse click away.

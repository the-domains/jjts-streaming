How could we talk about our work on video without mentioning the studio?

1 hour from London, on the south coast is our jewel on the south coast. A project years in the making we've got a 2 stage setup ready for your shoot.

Stage 1 is 7m x 5m, 2 sided infinity white cyc. It's hosted animals, vehicles and has had the interior of a cottage built in it.

Stage 2 is our pre-lit green screen stage always ready to go. It's 3.5m x 2.5m and painted chroma key green and evenly lit it makes the edit and VFX work a breeze.

> We loved our day at the studio, the food was amazing! I know it's a really odd thing to comment on but the whole day was so smooth and the catering whenever we weren't shooting was superb

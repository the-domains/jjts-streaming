How could we talk about our work on video without mentioning the studio?

1 hour from London is our jewel on the south coast. A project years in the making we've got a 2 stage setup ready for your shoot.

Stage 1 is 7m x 5m, 2 sided infinity white cyc. It's hosted animals, vehicles and has had the interior of a cottage built in it.

Stage 2 is our pre-lit green screen stage always ready to go. It's 3.5m x 2.5m and painted chroma key green and evenly lit it makes the edit and VFX work a breeze.

> We loved our day at the studio, the food was amazing! I know it's a really odd thing to comment on but the whole day was so smooth and the catering whenever we weren't shooting was superb****Sian B, Reach****

Everyone you meet when you visit the studio has years in the industry and will make sure that your time on site is pleasant and fun.

Plenty of space to chill out and get ready for action

**Office Space**

If you need a place to work while your shoot is taking place we have a boardroom space with Wi-Fi connectivity and a video feed to the studio so you can keep an eye on the action while you get things done!

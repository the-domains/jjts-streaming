How could we talk about our work on video without mentioning the studio?

1 hour from London is our jewel on the south coast. A project years in the making we've got a 2 stage setup ready for your shoot.

Stage 1 is 7m x 5m, 2 sided infinity white cyc. It's hosted animals, vehicles and has had the interior of a cottage built in it.

Stage 2 is our pre-lit green screen stage always ready to go. It's 3.5m x 2.5m and painted chroma key green and evenly lit it makes the edit and VFX work a breeze.

> We loved our day at the studio, the food was amazing! I know it's a really odd thing to comment on but the whole day was so smooth and the catering whenever we weren't shooting was superb****Sian B, Reach****

Everyone you meet when you visit the studio has years in the industry and will make sure that your time on site is pleasant and fun.

**Office Space**

If you need a place to work while your shoot is taking place we have a boardroom space with Wi-Fi connectivity and a video feed to the studio so you can keep an eye on the action while you get things done!

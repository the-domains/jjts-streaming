What you get when streaming your events:

* **Exclusivity:**There has never been a better way to make your potential new customers feel a part of something without actually being present. It's incredibly powerful.
* **Interactivity:**You can react to messages as they come in live, meaning you can answer questions and adapt the conversation to really engage your viewer.
* **Geographic Range:**Streaming over the web gives you unlimited range to broadcast. You can reach anyone, anywhere in the world with an internet connection!
* **Convenience:**You could for example deliver an internal training session across multiple sites simultaneously, eliminating the need for staff to travel and avoiding all the associated overheads. You could also make the sessions available 'on demand' afterwards for anyone that missed the live ones!
* **Wider Audiences:**With a web stream you can potential reach anyone with an internet connection. If you're aiming to break into new markets geographically or demographically it's an incredibly slick, easy way to tell someone about your company or invite them to your event!

Webinar is short for
Web-based Seminar, a presentation, lecture, workshop or seminar that is
transmitted over the Web. It is typically one-way form of communication from
the speaker to the audience with a bit of audience interaction, primarily
through chat.

****

**Most webinars are a
combination of a camera shot of the presenter and a Powerpoint or Keynote
presentation.**

A webinar can be
collaborative and include polling and question and answer sessions to allow
full participation between the audience and the presenter. all of which can be
easily controlled by the presenter or out AV technicians

**Why?**

Webinars are excellent
tools of marketing for engaging the audiences and advertising subtly without a
direct impact on the brand, product or services that they transmit.

Webinars can be
conducted through speakers present locally as well as globally. As the
attention span of the online viewers does not go beyond 2-3 hours, the agenda
of the webinar requires careful planning so as to ensure complete and
enthusiastic participation.

The two significant
pillars of success for Webinar are the speaker and the topic. A creation of the
webinar portal for the user is also possible wherein the archived as well as
the upcoming webinars can be put on display for the benefit of the audience.
